 a system that detects when you are about to leave your house  (using when you touch the shoes that are placed in a specific box in advanced as a signal)  after determining you are planning on leaving the house  it checks the weather, hence the webscraping  and tells you (with a pre-recorded voice, and LED lights) whether you need an umbrella or not ,depending on the info it gets from the site.

Was the original idea, scraped. Reasoning: currently improving programming specifically, not working on learning arduino, 3d printing, and electrical components.
